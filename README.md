This is an exercise developed during MIT xPro Full Stack Bootcamp

The "eyes" elements will follow the mouse position on the screen using mouse events

Demo: https://smoltypo.github.io/Eyes-Movement/


# About:
The objective of this exercise is to use Javascript to animates the eye image to follow the movement of the mouse cursor when it moves across the webpage. This code works by using the mousemove event listener to detect the x and y coordinates of the mouse and then updates the eye imageâ€™s position to match the position of the mouse cursor. This creates the illusion that the eye is following the mouse cursor.

# How to run:
This will run locally in your browser from index.html if you download all files and ensure they're located in the same directory as each other and have the same file structure (i.e. images folder with separately stored images.) 

# Future Roadmap:
This is a progression project, no further development is anticipated at this time.

# File structure:
  -index.html
  -eyes.js
  -styles.css
