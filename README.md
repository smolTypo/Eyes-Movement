The "eyes" elements will follow the mouse position on the screen using mouse events

# About:
The objective of this exercise is to use Javascript to animate eyes following the mouse cursor, using code that animates an eye image to follow the movement of the mouse cursor when it moves across the webpage. This code works by using the mousemove event listener to detect the x and y coordinates of the mouse and then updates the eye imageâ€™s position to match the position of the mouse cursor. This creates the illusion that the eye is following the mouse cursor.

# Future Roadmap:
This is a progression project, no further development is anticipated at this time.
