This is an exercise developed during MIT xPro Full Stack Bootcamp

Eye-movement exercise that will follow the mouse position across the screen using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript

Demo: https://smoltypo.github.io/Eyes-Movement/


## About:
The objective of this exercise is to use Javascript to animates the eye image to follow the movement of the mouse cursor when it moves across the webpage. This code works by using the mousemove event listener to detect the x and y coordinates of the mouse and then updates the eye imageâ€™s position to match the position of the mouse cursor. This creates the illusion that the eye is following the mouse cursor ðŸ‘€

CSS was used to style the page layout; HTML div element was used for the focus of the eye-movement exercise; JavaScript function to update the position of the HTML element whenever the mouse moves. 

## How to run:
This will run locally in your browser from index.html if you download all files and ensure they're located in the same directory as each other and have the same file structure (i.e. images folder with separately stored images.) 
  
## Future Roadmap:
This is a progression project, no further development is anticipated at this time.
But if I get ambitious: One potential improvement for this exercise would be to add additional elements that can be tracked along with the mouse. This could include other images or divs that move in response to the mouse position. Another potential improvement would be to make the exercise more challenging by adding obstacles or other elements that the user must navigate. Additionally, the exercise could be made more visually appealing with animations or other effects.
